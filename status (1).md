#### What have you done for your project so far?
We  have finished all the possible story lines and began to draw the pictures for the story book, which should be completed by Wednesday. We have also looked into the interactive section.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We still have to code, but we are pretty sure we can do that over a couple days if we really dedicated a good amount of time to it and figure the code all out. But first we are trying to understand the full general concept of how to do the story board.


#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Nothing so far, we are just trying to figure out certain secitons of the project.
